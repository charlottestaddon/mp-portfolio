  <h3>Photography Evidence</h3>
  <p>I used my phone to take my photographs as it is more accessible because my theme is architecture and landscapes, therefore I always have my phone with me. My phone also has many of the same features you would find on a DSLR camera such as the grid on the screen, which helps with the rule of thirds and also centralising photos, which I have used for many of my pictures. For example, I used the rule of thirds when taking the Media City Footbridge and sunset photograph. I also used the grid for taking a central image of St Ann Street to keep the street in the middle of the image with the buildings on either side, adding depth to my image. I also used leading lines in my images for example on the tram tracks as all the lines lead towards the centre of the image which adds depth and draws your attention further into the image. I also took an image using the frame within in a frame technique through the bars of a bridge in Manchester, this neatly frames the image and brings the focus towards the buildings in the background.</p>

  <h3>Video Evidence</h3>
  <p>To film our MOTDX clip we borrowed equipment from the media lab, such as a video camera, tripod and audio equipment. As camera operator my role was to make sure that all the shots were the correct framing and also make sure that the lighting and white balance was correct. We filmed the Vox Pops in various places like the Bridgewater Canal near Old Trafford Football Stadium as it links to football, we also filmed outside of university and also in the reception. We added a title sequence with graphics for the logo and the numbers in a neon pink colour which links to the main colour scheme of the MOTDX show. In some of the shots we filmed, the white balance settings could have been adjusted to make the lighting in the image look better. White balance removes the unrealistic colour casts to make the shots look more realistic (Understanding White Balance, 2021). We also set the camera up on a tripod so we could keep the camera at eye level with the presenters and also when filming the vox pops we kept the camera at eye level with the people we interviewed. </p>

  <h3>Social Delivery Formats</h3>
  <p>We created the original package in the format of a landscape widescreen broadcast piece which is in the aspect ratio of 16:9 and a resolution of 1920p x 1080p. For the social media piece we had to resize it for it to be posted on Instagram. Instagram, uses the format of a 1:1 aspect ratio (square) and 1080p x 1080p resolution. We decided to use Instagram because the target audience for MOTDX is younger people “who are interested in football, music and culture from around the Premier League” (BBC, 2021). Over the years the attention span of social media users has decreased therefore we had to create a clip between 10-30 seconds to limit the chances of people scrolling past. Therefore we took the highlights from the original broadcast and edited them together in a square format to be posted on Instagram. We displayed our original piece on YouTube, the reason for this is because it is easily accessible for everyone and as it is for social media and younger people we filmed it in a less formal way. </p>
