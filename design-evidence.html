  <h3>Colour Theory</h3>
  <p>The psychology behind the colour pink is that it has been proven to have a calming impact on the users, which links in well with the purpose of my website as I want to highlight the photography and video sections as they are the main focus of the website.</p>
  <p>I paired the pink with a monochromatic black and white colour scheme as the connotations of the colour grey are formal and sophisticated. This fits well with my target audience for the website as it is aimed at media professionals, therefore I have kept the colours formal, with the page headings in pink to make them stand out more on the page. The colours pink and grey also have a good contrast together as this was important as I wanted the headings and subheadings to be easy to read against the monochromatic black and white header.</p>
  <p>As pink is a warm colour it is emphasised nicely against the cool grey colour (Beaird et al, 2020). Colour psychology is important in creating certain emotions in a person. To change the colour of my website I changed the HEX codes in Atom which is located in the CSS folder.</p>

  <h3>Typography</h3>
  <p>I used the font ‘Quicksand’ in Sans-Serif for both the titles and the body. I set the weight of the font to 400 as it helped make the titles stand out against the monochromatic black and white photograph in the background. The weight 400 also suited the body text as it is easy to read and has a professional look. I used the Google Fonts website to find a font that went well with the design of my website. Quicksand was designed by Andrew Paglinawan in 2008 using geometric shapes as a core foundation to be designed to be legible enough to be used in large and smaller font sizes. (Google Fonts, 2021). I made the titles a much larger size so that they stand out clearly as visual hierarchy is important for users to be able to differentiate between different sections I achieved this by making the subheadings and headings larger than the main body of text. This makes it clear to the users of how to read the website from start to finish with a clear visual flow. </p>

  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
  <p>Web accessibility is the tools and technologies that are designed to enable people with disabilities to still be able to understand and easily navigate the website. In Atom I edited the alt text code to describe in detail my photographs. The alt text is also useful for people in situations where their images may not load, this could be due to poor internet connection, so they would be able to see the description displayed on the screen.</p>
   <p>It is important to make the website as accessible to everyone as possible, as it is more inclusive and gives people with wide ranges of accessibilities the opportunity to use the website. “As designers, it’s our responsibility to know how our design affect these interactions and create mismatches” (Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit, n.d). I used Quicksand font as it is designed to be easily legible when used in a large font size and also small font size therefore it makes it easier to read for people with visual impairments. I also used pink for the page titles as it stands out clearly from the monochromatic black and white background.</p>
